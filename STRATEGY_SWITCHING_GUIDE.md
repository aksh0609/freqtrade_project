## 💡 When to Use Which Strategy?

### Use RSI-MACD When:
- ✅ Market is trending strongly up or down
- ✅ You want fewer, potentially higher-quality trades
- ✅ You're patient and don't need frequent trades
- ✅ You expect significant price movements

### Use Bollinger Bands When:
- ✅ Market is moving sideways (ranging)
- ✅ You want more frequent trades
- ✅ You want to test and learn faster
- ✅ You prefer active trading with quick exits

## 🔄 How to Switch Strategies

### Method 1: Using Scripts (Easiest)

1. Open Terminal in freqtrade directory
2. Run the script for your desired strategy:
   ```bash
   ./start_rsi_macd.sh
   # OR
   ./start_bollinger.sh
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Stop the current bot
   - Start with the new strategy
   - Show confirmation message

### Method 2: Manual Command

```bash
# Stop current bot
pkill -f "freqtrade trade"

# Start with desired strategy
freqtrade trade -c user_data/config_bybit_spot.json --strategy RSI_MACD_Strategy
# OR
freqtrade trade -c user_data/config_bybit_spot.json --strategy BollingerBands_Strategy
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Strategy Switching:
- **Cannot switch from UI** - This is a Freqtrade limitation
- **Requires bot restart** - Trades will be preserved
- **Open trades continue** - They follow the original strategy's exit rules
- **No data loss** - All trade history is saved in the database

### About Open Trades:
When you switch strategies:
- ✅ Open trades remain open
- ✅ They continue with their original entry strategy's exit rules
- ✅ New trades will use the new strategy
- ✅ Trade history is preserved

4. Switch to **RSI-MACD** to compare
5. Choose your preferred strategy

### For Serious Trading:
1. Backtest both strategies over 30+ days
2. Compare win rates, profit, and drawdown
3. Choose based on current market conditions
4. Monitor and adjust as needed
